## Best Camera so far

### NC 147 (Toll) & Davis Drive
In the lower right corner is the closest view of boundry of roadway and elevated roadway.  However, the corresponding median portion is not visible.  Such a pity, they could have angled the camera down a few degress and it would be perfect.

## Potential cameras
This [site](https://drivenc.gov/#adverse-weather)  has potential cameras.  However they are tiny low res images and not live.  I have contacted the NCDOT but not received a response.

These are static jpg's.  

The urls look like its a camera name and timestamp.  Could I just webscrape with that?

### I-440 & US 64 Bypass
This one has a good view of white line, shoulder and appears to be potentially high res.  Its also not obscurred with text overlay.

### I-540 & US 401 
This one could be hi-res.  It shows the seam between road and elevated roadway.

Newer camera.  Shows junction of roadway and elevated roadway, but distant.
